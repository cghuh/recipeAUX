	Move central header file to top-level directory

	* example.h: Rename from example/example.h, so that the location in
	in the source directory hierarchy matches the relative installation
	location.  Also, moving the file allows for example.h to be included
	from code within the source tree.
	* Makefile.am (nobase_example_include_HEADERS): Adjust list of header
	files accordingly.

	Update and clean configure.ac

	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Also provide the home page argument.
	(AC_PREREQ): Add minimum Autoconf version requirement, as a generally
	good habit.
	(AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Add minimum version and the no-define option to
	the argument list, also because it's generally a good habit to do so.
	Remove the subdir-objects option, as it is now defined directly in the
	Makefile.am file.
	(AC_CONFIG_HEADERS): Generate two configuration headers; one for the
	build itself with an autogenerated template, and a second one which
	will be installed alongside the library.
	(AC_PROG_CXX_C_O): Remove call.  Checking for -c -o support is only
	required for the C compiler, and then the Automake-specific macro
	AM_PROG_CC_C_O must be used.
	(AC_PROG_INSTALL): Remove check, as Automake should take care of that
	by itself if needed.
	(EXAMPLE_FULL_NAME): Remove redundant substitution.
	(AC_CONFIG_FILES): Substitute the API version into the filename of the
	generated .pc file from a variable, and override the template filename
	to not include the version number.
	* example.pc.in: Rename from example-1.0.pc.in.  Adjust substitutions
	to changes in configure.ac.
	* exampleconfig.h.in: New header file template.  Empty for now; a good
	usage example still needs to be provided.

	Update and heavily comment Makefile.am

	* Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Set the subdir-objects option here,
	in order to make the file self-contained.  It is also one of the few
	options which can reasonably be used on a per-directory basis.
	(ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS): Set variable to ${ACLOCAL_FLAGS}, similar to what
	we do in the build files of the GNOME C++ binding modules.  I want it
	to become a widely used pattern.
	(nobase_example_include_HEADERS): Combine all header files into one
	list and use the nobase_ prefix.
	(nodist_example_libinclude_HEADERS): The installed configuration
	header file should never be the fully auto-generated config.h file!
	That one is for the build itself only, and installing it causes
	serious breakage if anyone ever tries to actually use it.  Installing
	it with the name config.h makes it even worse.  Use a separate file
	with a manually edited template instead.

	Simplify autogen.sh

	* autogen.sh: Remove the sub-shell and pass the source directory to
	autoreconf as command line argument.  Also enable verbose output.

0.4:

	Major rewrite

0.3:

2002-01-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Now uses pkg-config.
