BUILDING/INSTALLING THE LIBRARY
----------------------------------------------------------

The "INSTALL" file contains step-by-step instructions on
how to build and install this library.

----------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLES OF USE
----------------------------------------------------------

There are a number of simple example programs in the 
"examples" directory which illustrate how to calculate
variables like mT2 in stand-along C++ programs.

These should be built automatically during the build (i.e.
when you typed "make").  The compiled programs should go 
into the directory from which 
you typed "make).  E.g., after building the library, you 
should be able to do

We recommend that all users of the library look first
at the simple example program:

	examples/helloWorld_Mt2_Example.cpp

and then adapt it to their use.  It should have
been compiled automatically when you built the library, 
and so you should be able to run it like this:

	./example_helloWorld_Mt2_Example

See more information on this example (including how to
compile it simply without using a makefile) at:

	http://www.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk/~lester/mt2/index.html#hello

More experienced users or users who need the very fastest
MT2 implementation might like to consider reviewing a different
example:

	examples/ChengHanBisect_Mt2_332_Calculator_Example.cpp

which is run with:

	./example_ChengHanBisect_Mt2_332_Calculator_Example

----------------------------------------------------------
USING SEMI-INTERACTIVELY WITH ROOT
----------------------------------------------------------

After you have built and installed the library, you may be
interested to read the insructions at the top of the file

	examples/demo_1_for_ROOT_usage.C

which give an example of how you could use the library
from within ROOT.

The oxbridgekinematics library allows you to calculate mT2
and other related kinamatic variables.
